# Data Analyst Project: Gaming Industry Analysis

## Overview
This data analyst project aims to analyze the gaming industry using a dataset of top-selling video games. We'll explore various aspects of the gaming market, including genres, platforms, sales trends, and publisher insights. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales) used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about the top 100-selling video games, including details such as rank, name, platform, year, genre, publisher, and sales data. The dataset is provided in a CSV format (vgsales.csv).

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading
- Load the dataset (vgsales.csv) into a pandas DataFrame.
- Check for missing values, data types, and summary statistics of numerical columns.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values, including dropping rows with missing values for Publisher and Year columns.
- Save the cleaned dataset to a new file (cleaned_vgsales.csv).

### 3. Genre Analysis
- Identify the gaming genre with the highest total global sales.
- Visualize the distribution of global sales by genre using a boxplot.

### 4. Platform Analysis
- Identify the gaming platform with the most games released.
- Visualize the distribution of global sales across different platforms using a boxplot.

### 5. Publisher Insights
- Identify the top publishers in terms of the number of games published.
- Identify the publisher with the highest total global sales.

### 6. Time Series Analysis
- Analyze how the number of game releases has changed over the years.
- Analyze trends in global sales over time.
- Identify significant spikes or drops in sales in specific years.

### 7. Regional Sales Analysis
- Determine the contribution of each region (North America, Europe, Japan, others) to global sales.
- Explore whether specific regions have preferences for certain genres or platforms.

### 8. Player Behavior and Preferences
- Analyze player preferences within specific genres or platforms.
- Draw conclusions about player preferences based on sales data.

## Code Implementation

The code for this data analysis project is implemented in Python, utilizing the following libraries:

- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Numerical computations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.

Each analysis task is represented by Python code snippets, which can be found in the project's main script.

## Conclusion
The project is ongoing, and additional analyses and visualizations will be conducted to provide a comprehensive understanding of the gaming industry.

Please refer to the project code and Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis and code implementation.
